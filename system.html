        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>The ranking of players in the MKOTH League is based on their Elo.
            Players challenge each other in a best of 3 series to better their Elo.</p>
        <h4>Classes</h4>
        <p>There are 4 classes in the MKOTH rankings, which are determined by their Elo.</p>
        <div class="container">
            <ul>
                <li>Nobleman: 1400 and above</li>
                <li>Squire: 1300 to 1399</li>
                <li>Vassal: 1250 to l299</li>
                <li>Peasant: 1249 and below</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>The king is a special title awarded to the top ranking player on the condition that there are at least 2 other noblemen present on the rankings.</p>

        </div>
        <p>
            As seen from the table above, Points can be gained or lost. No negative points shall be allowed.
            A player gains points when he wins a series. If he wins against a player of lower Elo than him,
            he gains only 1 point. If he wins against a player of same or higher Elo than him, he gains 3 points.
            A player loses 5 points when he loses against a player of more than 1300 Elo and of 300 or more Elo than him.
            <b>Hence, having 5 points is a prerequisite before a player is able to challenge someone of a much higher Elo.</b>
        </p>
        <h4>Holiday Mode (HM)</h4>
        <p>A player moves into HM when he does not complete a series within 30 days</p>

                    and both players have to continue playing until a player gets 2 wins. Maps cannot be repeated unless all maps have
