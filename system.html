    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>The ranking of players in the MKOTH League is based on their ELO. 
    Players challenge each other in a best of 3 series to better their ELO.</p>
    <h4>Classes</h4>
    <p>There are 4 classes in the MKOTH rankings, which are determined by their ELO.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Nobleman: 1400 and above</li>
      <li>Squire: 1300 to 1399</li>
      <li>Vassal: 1250 to l299</li>
      <li>Peasant: 1249 and below</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>The king is a special title awarded to the top ranking player on the condition that there are at least 2 noblemen present on the rankings.</p>
    <h4>Points</h4>
    <div class="seriesrule">
      <table class="ruletable">
      <caption>Table of points</caption>
      <tr class="ruletr">
        <th class="ruletd">Series Result</th>
        <th class="ruletd">Net Change in Points</th>
      </tr>
      <tr class="ruletr">
        <td class="ruletd">Win (above)</td>
        <td class="ruletd">3</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="ruletr">
      <td class="ruletd">Win (below)</td>
      <td class="ruletd">1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="ruletr">
        <td class="ruletd">Lose (200+)</td>
        <td class="ruletd">-5</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="ruletr">

        <td class="ruletd">0</td>
      </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    <p>As seen from the table above, Points can be gained or lost. No negative points shall be allowed. 
    A player gains points when he wins a series. If he wins against a player of lower ELO than him, 
    he gains only 1 point. If he wins against a player of same or higher ELO than him, he gains 3 points. 
    A player loses 5 points when he loses against a player of 200 or more ELO than him. 
    <b>Hence having 5 points is a prerequisite before a player is able to challenge someone of a much higher ELO.</b></p>
    <h4>Holiday Mode (HM)</h4>
    <p>A player moves into HM when he does not complete a series within 30 days</p>

        <td class="ruletd">The starting map is <b>Wattle Resort</b>. Either
        player can invite for the starting map. If there is a dispute over who should invite first, the lower ranked player
        must invite for the first map, followed by the person selecting the map.</td>

    <tr>
        <td class="ruletd">4</td>
        <td class="ruletd">It is considered a draw if both players have same amount of lives by the start of round 38 OR if both players reaches
        0 lives before round 38 OR a the same defeat/victory screen is presented on both players screens. If there is a draw,
        the person who didn't pick the map will invite and select the next map. Games that are drawn do not count as a complete
        game in a series. For example, in a best of 3 series, if there is 1 win and 2 draws, the series is considered incomplete
        and both players have to continue playing until a player gets 2 wins. Maps cannot be repeated unless all maps have
        been played during the series.</td>
