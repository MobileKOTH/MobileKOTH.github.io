    <p>The ranking system consists of the King, who is in rank 1, and 4 different classes of players.</p>
    <p>The challenger refers to the lower ranked player and the defender refers to the higher ranked player. However in a point
      series, this does not matter.</p>
    <p>The lowest class in the ranking is the Peasant class. This class includes all players under rank 50.</p>
    <p>The third highest class is the Vassals class. This class includes all players under rank 30 to rank 50.</p>
    <p>The second highest class is the Squire class. This class includes players who are on or above rank 30 but has not won
      at least one knight series as a challenger. Hence, this class behaves differently from the previous 2 classes. The
      number of players in this class may decrease as more people beat knights to enter the nobleman class. This class will
      no longer become smaller when it has 20 players. </p>
    <p>Finally, the highest class in the ranking is the Nobleman class. This class includes players from rank 2 and below that
      have won at least one knight series as a challenger. This class is capped at rank 10. After the cap is reached, the
      nobleman in rank 10 will be demoted to the Squire class whenever a player gets promoted to the Nobleman class. </p>
    <h4>What are knights?</h4>
    <p>Knights are the strongest players in Mobile King of the Hill and protect their King and the Noblemen. You can challenge
      one of the Knights into a best of 5 knight series but you are required to be a squire and will cost you 18 points.
      If you succeed beating one of the strong Knights, you are officially one of the mighty Noblemen in Mobile King of the
      Hill. You can only challenge the same knight to a knight series once every 3 days. However, you can challenge a different
      knight everyday. Every time a Knight will be beaten, the Nobleman class gets one new Nobleman while the Squire class
      lose a Squire until the Nobleman class reaches the rank 20 cap. After the cap is reached, players that beat knights
      will take over the player in rank 20. Knights are chosen manually.</p>

    <p>The knights are:</p>

    <h4></h4>Ranked series</h4>
    <p>You can rank yourself up by challenging people for a ranked series. </p>
    <p>You can challenge players within the same class for a ranked series for free, so peasants can challenge any other peasant
      for a ranked series and so can vassals, squires and noblemen. If you want to move to a higher class, you need to pay
      an extra fee to start the ranked series. It costs 12 points to challenge a squire and 6 points to challege a vassal.
      Kings cannot be challenged to ranked series. Ranked series between peasants, vassals or squires is best of 3 while
      a ranked series between noblemen is best of 5. When a challenger defeats a defender, the challenger takes over the
      position of the defender and gains some points, while the defender drops a rank and goes home empty handed When a defender
      wins the challenger successfully, the challenger will remain in the current position, while the defender receives some
      points.
    </p>
    <p>Winner of Nobleman vs Nobleman series:</p>

    <p>7 points</p>

    <p>Winner of Squire vs Squire series:</p>

    <p>5 points</p>

    <p>Winner of Vassal vs Vassal series:</p>

    <p>3 points</p>

    <p>Winner of Peasant vs Peasant series:</p>

    <p>2 points</p>

    <h4>Point series</h4>
    <p>It's possible to play players beyond ranked series. Point series doesn't affect your ranking position or points. You
      can challenge anyone for a best of 3 point series, regardless of your rank and your opponent’s rank. However, only
      the winner will get 2 points. You can spend points into perks which you can find in the perk shop below.</p>

    <h4>King series</h4>
    <p>When you feel that you are strong enough, you may challenge the king’s position by playing a  best of 5 king series with
      him. Before you can start a king series, ensure that you are a nobleman class and the king does not have an ongoing
      king series. </p>

    <p>If the challenger defeats the king in a king series, the challenger will become the new king! The defeated king will
      be forced to step down to rank 2 and end his reign as king. However, if the king successfully defends the king series,
      he will earn 7 points while the challenger goes home empty-handed. The king is NOT obligated to play challengers in
      the order they challenged the king and has the right to play whoever is more convenient instead.</p>

    <p>If you have experience in commentating and you are good at battles, you can offer to commentate series for the King of
      the Hill channel! You can get 5 points for each successful commentary. If you are interested, please private message
      a manager to apply.</p>

    <h4>Series Rules</h4>

    <p>All games are played in assault mode with classic rules.</p>
    <p>The starting map is Hot Tub/Yello Brick Road. The lower ranked player will choose one of the 2 possible starting maps. Either
      player can invite for the starting map. If there is a dispute over who should invite first, the lower ranked player
      must invite for the first map, followed by the person selecting the map.</p>
    <p>The game ends when a player reaches 0 lives, or at the start of round 38. The player with most lives at the end wins.
      The player who lost in the game will decide the map for the next game.</p>
    <p>It is considered a draw if both players have same amount of lives by the start of round 38 OR if both players reaches
      0 lives before round 38 OR a the same defeat/victory screen is presented on both players screens. If there is a draw,
      the person who didn't pick the map will invite and select the next map. Games that are drawn do not count as a complete
      game in a series. For example, in a best of 3 series, if there is 1 win and 2 draws, the series is considered incomplete
      and both players have to continue playing until a player gets 2 wins. Maps cannot be repeated unless all maps have
      been played during the series.</p>
    <p>The X-4 Heli Pilot upgrade is banned. Up to 3 energy spikes are allowed during a game. 4th tower may be used if BOTH
      players agree, otherwise, it is prohibited by default.(refer to rule 10)</p>
    <p>If one player disconnects during a game, the other player decides whether to rematch, take the win or take a draw.</p>
    <p>Players have the right to add or amend any rules mentioned above  for their series, as long as both players agree.</p>
    <p>Unless the item from the points shop is purchased, players can only do one series with the same person on 1 day. It must
      be a different day for both players before a new series between the two of them can begin.
      <p>Players must wait at least 48 hours before they can start another king series with the same opponent, regardless of
        perks purchased.</p>
      <p>Players are not allowed to dodge series after it begins. If a player avoids playing the opponent more than 2 times
        when he is able to, the opponent may claim a forfeit win with manager’s approval. Managers will make a final decision
        on whether the player is dodging based on chat evidence.</p>
      <p>Cheating of any kind, such as modding, abusing glitches, hacking or spying(battles tv) is strictly prohibited. The
        manager also has the right to deem any act as cheating even though it hasn't been mentioned before. Nobleman Class</p>
