    <h1>Overview</h1>

    <h1>Series Rules</h1>

    <p>All games are played in assault mode with classic rules.</p>
    <p>The starting map is Hot Tub/Yello Brick Road. The lower ranked player will choose one of the 2 possible starting maps. Either
      player can invite for the starting map. If there is a dispute over who should invite first, the lower ranked player
      must invite for the first map, followed by the person selecting the map.</p>
    <p>The game ends when a player reaches 0 lives, or at the start of round 38. The player with most lives at the end wins.
      The player who lost in the game will decide the map for the next game.</p>
    <p>It is considered a draw if both players have same amount of lives by the start of round 38 OR if both players reaches
      0 lives before round 38 OR a the same defeat/victory screen is presented on both players screens. If there is a draw,
      the person who didn't pick the map will invite and select the next map. Games that are drawn do not count as a complete
      game in a series. For example, in a best of 3 series, if there is 1 win and 2 draws, the series is considered incomplete
      and both players have to continue playing until a player gets 2 wins. Maps cannot be repeated unless all maps have
      been played during the series.</p>
    <p>The X-4 Heli Pilot upgrade is banned. Up to 3 energy spikes are allowed during a game. 4th tower may be used if BOTH
      players agree, otherwise, it is prohibited by default.(refer to rule 10)</p>
    <p>If one player disconnects during a game, the other player decides whether to rematch, take the win or take a draw.</p>
    <p>Players have the right to add or amend any rules mentioned above  for their series, as long as both players agree.</p>
    <p>Unless the item from the points shop is purchased, players can only do one series with the same person on 1 day. It must
      be a different day for both players before a new series between the two of them can begin.
      <p>Players must wait at least 48 hours before they can start another king series with the same opponent, regardless of
        perks purchased.</p>
      <p>Players are not allowed to dodge series after it begins. If a player avoids playing the opponent more than 2 times
        when he is able to, the opponent may claim a forfeit win with manager’s approval. Managers will make a final decision
        on whether the player is dodging based on chat evidence.</p>
      <p>Cheating of any kind, such as modding, abusing glitches, hacking or spying(battles tv) is strictly prohibited. The
        manager also has the right to deem any act as cheating even though it hasn't been mentioned before. Nobleman Class</p>
