        <td class="ruletd">The starting map is Shapes. The lower ranked player will choose one of the 2 possible starting maps. Either
        player can invite for the starting map. If there is a dispute over who should invite first, the lower ranked player
        must invite for the first map, followed by the person selecting the map.</td>

        <td class="ruletd">The game ends when a player reaches 0 lives, or at the start of round 38. The player with most lives at the end wins.

    <tr>
        <td class="ruletd">4</td>
        <td class="ruletd">It is considered a draw if both players have same amount of lives by the start of round 38 OR if both players reaches
        0 lives before round 38 OR a the same defeat/victory screen is presented on both players screens. If there is a draw,
        the person who didn't pick the map will invite and select the next map. Games that are drawn do not count as a complete
        game in a series. For example, in a best of 3 series, if there is 1 win and 2 draws, the series is considered incomplete
        and both players have to continue playing until a player gets 2 wins. Maps cannot be repeated unless all maps have
        been played during the series.</td>
